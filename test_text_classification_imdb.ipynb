( Black Widow storyline, Iron Man storyline) About Captain America, they give him poor ending, about Thor, they made him a Joke! About Hulk, they made him powerless! About the other characters, they put them in the movie only to say that they put them! And finally, ZERO PURE SUPERHERO ACTION!!! Only 10-15 minutes, only!!

After 5 years you should be able to balance the choice of leaving everything as it is OR going back and changing everything back to how it was. Keep in mind 5 years is a very long time to have been pronounced dead. The paperwork to bring these people back into the system and the burden they will now be on the economy and Social Security, at least for a while, would be enough to bankrupt a nation. Conveniently, all MCU\\'s family and friends were either fine or they had all vanished together so having them come back unharmed, albeit 5 years later, is a relief. That is not likely the case for the rest of the world though. Most of the people coming back are coming back to a drastically changed world. Most will be homeless, they have no jobs, no way of getting a job, not soon enough, anyway. Some will have lost family members and beloved pets during that time, to old age, suicide, accidents and all sorts of natural causes. And some, if not most, will be coming back to a world that moved on without them. Their loved ones may have already found others or have been changed so drastically that they\\'re strangers now. If you watched Tom Hank\\'s \"Cast Away\" and recall his hopelessness after coming back to life to find his house sold, his insurance cashed, his job taken, his industry changed, his wife remarried... Now multiply that by half of the Universe\\'s life forms and you have an unmitigated tragedy of cosmic proportions. All so that Tony gets to keep his 4-year-old?\\nNo. Tony Stark\\'s toughest choice should have been that. Am I willing to sacrifice my daughter to save half the life in the Universe?

       "  'review_text': \"And then the time travel ordeal... If the operating theory is that you cannot change the past then you should be unable to change the past, PERIOD. The only things that can happen are the things that have already happened. In that scenario, it is plausible to assume you'll be able to go back in time, steal the Infinity Stones unnoticed and then but them back... But all of this is only possible IF they have already happened. Complicated yet theoretically possible. You can even justify Thor's conversation with his mom or the Ancient One's chat with Banner because we were unaware that these things had already happened then, even if it is our first time seeing it. But then you have the Cap fighting with himself and telling other's he's with Hydra, Loki's escape and the cap moving back to the past to grow old together with his long lost love. You could argue that the Cap made himself forget the fight with the scepter and lived secretly in a basement for the rest of his life, but REALLY? And what about all the undercover Hydra operatives that will soon find that the Cap is not really on their side and hence must know of their own involvement and what about Loki? How was he still a prisoner for the end scene in Avengers when Thor escorts him back to Assgard and where he is later seen in prison? And how are we reconstructing the Tesarract and putting the Ether back into Natalie Portman? Or CAN you change the past after all? So why not do the unthinkable and kill one baby (Thanos) to save half the Universe? Send Hawkeye and Black Widow to do it. Why not travel in time to beat Thanos at Wakanda, now with the help of the entire team, including all of the dispersed heroes and Captain Marvel? Or did we just create 6 different alternate realities and timelines but somehow feel good about our victory in just this one? And is the Cap comfortable going back to 1945, hanging his shield and watching history unfold without altering a single thing, knowing full well all the lives he could've saved (think Vietnam, Kennedy, 9/11, etc.)?\"},\n",

       "  'review_text': 'I don\\'t understand the hype behind this movie or most of the Marvel movies. I went into this movie open minded after hearing everyone tell me how great it was and after the first hour and a half I was bored. It\\'s almost as if Marvel has started to make comedy movies rather than super hero action movies. Now I am fine with having some comic relief but holy hell. For starters, they completely ruined the Hulk and Thor who are two of the most powerful and captivating characters. I don\\'t understand why they just decided to have the Hulk become a big joke of a character but they did. I thought his main thing was that he was angry all the time which made him way more interesting than a science nerd but ok I guess so. Then they decide to make Thor just a slob that drinks beer and plays fortnite. I saw Korg holding the controller and thought to myself \"if they are playing fortnite this movie is embarrassing\" and believe it or not they were. I could not believe it when I saw what they did to Thor. The God of Thunder and King of Asgard has a mid life crisis after losing to Thanos when he has 1000 years of being a battle tested warrior and is now an overweight bum and is that for the ENTIRE MOVIE.\\nThe other thing in this movie that made me mad was that they tried to force all of these character relationships onto the viewer. I do not care about Hawkeye and Black Widows weird romance/friendship because as far as I can see, they are both kinda useless in the grand scheme of things. Honestly they both probably should have died in the first avengers but we will blame plot armor for that one. I also do not care about captain America and Peggy\\'s relationship or Tony Starks new family that is a thing when the movie just jumps ahead in tome 5 years. This is probably because I think Pepper is one of the most annoying movie character of all time.\\nThe last thing I will rant about is the fighting. For a 3 hour movie you would expect to see some cool fight scenes but no. We got a bunch of fast moving shots and a lot of different characters running with the gauntlet. To make matters worse, Thanos was just so not intimidating in the slightest. It\\'s almost as if he stood 0 chance and everyone knew it. Overall this movie was 3 hours of superheroes sitting around telling some dumb jokes that people think are hilarious for some reason and then winning the battle with little trouble.\\nOther problem with the movie:\\n1. Bucky should have gotten Captains shield\\n2. Time travel? Really. Stark figures out time travel in 30 minutes after 5 years of sitting around and it works without any problem besides when captain America fought his past self and somehow nobody in the building saw it.\\n3. Thor joining the guardians is cool but also WTF\\n4. Captain Marvel should have just stayed with the avengers and try to fix the problem rather than run off to other planets and come back at very convenient times. Total cop out\\n5. The hulk should have fought thanos. Total blown opportunity'},\n",

First, I have watched every superhero movie that lead to the creation of this movie. Please don't believe the critic reviews or other obviously paid for reviews. This movie was horribly boring, with very limited action. I enjoy comicbook and fantasy movies, but I also enjoy a good drama. The issue isn't that I couldn't appreciate the emotional aspect of the movie, it's simply that it was done very poorly. There were so many issues with the plot, and characters, but worst of all is a tremendous amount of pointless, long sections of uninteresting dialog. On top of this, the very few action scenes that were in the movie were really poorly done. For the most part, they were a blurry, choppy mess, and you couldn't appreciate what was happening enough to make it effective and cool. If you like movies that are boring, and try to play on your heart strings in a really contrived way, instead of being entertaining, then this is the perfect movie for you.\"},\n",

I know they wanted to give Iron man a farewell but in a satisfying way, in movie it felt like it was totally useless. And what about Hulk and thanos encounter , oh yeah there wasn't one. I was waiting for proffessor Hulk to step up to Thanos , another disappointment.\\nMany people liked the last interaction between Hawkeye and Black widow but personally found it cringy and over dramatic with lame writing.\\nIn IW you can clearly see every character was given their share of screen time and justified roles but Endgame was mess .\\nI have watched IW in theatres 4 times plus many times at home and i would still watch it and enjoy but Endgame i can't.\\nMany stupid fanboys and casual watchers might find this movie good but the people who likes things making sense and a story which takes you deep into it would feel how unsatisfying this movie is .\\nEven casting Brie Larson as captian marvel wasn't that bad as this movie .\"},\n",

Yup, that\\'s as deep as that conversation went. Immediately they were back to the tired old \\'save humanity from evil Thanos\\' plot.

It is action scene after action science with a few lines and a great deal of flashbacks to original Marvel Superhero films. This is the worst time travel movie I have ever viewed. TV Shows such as Outlander and Game of Thrones deal with time travel and flash backs respectively. This movie could have had an hour of superfluous action removed and more money could have been utilized for writers to make the story more concise and give us a chance to say goodbye to our favorite Marvel superheroes. In addition, the costumes were cheesy and as I viewed the film in IMAX I noticed that the costumes didn't fit the characters well. For example, the most ubiquitous costume problem was that their boots appeared to be two sizes too big. The sets were not convincing while the cinematographer would show the whole set then zoom in on a character's oversized boots. By the time, the war with Thanos began during the last 45 minutes it was total chaos with Tony Stark martyring himself for all Avengers and humanity. The writing, in the end, failed to unify all the films. I hoped the writers could pull together the twenty two film collection with a solid introduction, body, and conclusion. The end product was too much action, very little dialogue (except boring hazing), cheesy costumes, poor sets, too many character's whose fate was unclear.\"},\n",

First I missed it with infinity war. A lot of mistakes that were not allowed to happen. Hulk, who during the whole series of avengers is unbeatable and who is beaten more and more becomes stronger and stronger, he is the greatest weakman, and also the vision that at that moment was the most powerful member of their family. I can understand that Tanos was extremely dominant about the stones, but the fact that the person who wrote the script was a lot of work, and then they made so many illogicalities that do not happen in children's films, for such a film is extremely bad. Then hopes fell on the end game. Hoping that at least a portion of these errors will be corrected and made a much better film that follows all the previous happenings in the entire series of Avenger, Iron Men, Torah ... did not happen. The opposite happened. They made many more errors than they could ever make. I'll only include a couple of extreme errors. The first who watched the Guardians of the Galaxy meant that then it was said that no mortal can hold infinity stones, let alone use it, and here they played with them as with clicks. Suddenly, the captain of America becomes the god of lightning, is it realistic that you did it, and after all, I do not know why Tanos needed stones at all when he threw them out of stone as a toy, if we already found out that the hula was beaten because he had a stone at that time power, what did he have now? Again I emphasize the film about the special effects and from the technical side fantastic and that it is completely separate from me would get a grade 10.

I'm sorry, 20 Avengers and none of them couldn't do anything??? And why did Tony had to die out of all the other characters?? Seriously, couldn't Falcon, Dr. Strange or Mantis die instead - they were good for nothing. And how did Falcon get to be Captain America? What about Bucky-- War Machine-- heck even Rocket would have been better. A good 45 minutes of poor blah blah that could have been used for action fight scenes. Disappointments everywhere.\"},\n",

Thor was no different.. they turned the once noble and proud warrior into a fat simpering slob.

Their roles were both so down played as a result that I am not sure the movie goers would have missed their presence in the movie. As far as Captain America and Iron man goes I found their actions predictable.

In earlier version of avengers (infinity stones) thor was after creating a weapon to fight thanos and by the end he used it where thanos can resist it even with gauntlet stones power, here in this even without any gauntlet or stones the same weapon can do nothing ...just throwing here and there ,Thats it ! (now y did captain america can use it ! They desimatted the character thor , helpless powerless guy )\\n2. After all that fight with thanos all together, no one even cannot move the gauntlet from his hand (remember not single handed, tried by many characters all together in earlier version too) then how come tony stark can go and replace the gauntlet, that too single handed..(this is very important because its the main end scene of the fight)..atleast they could use support of captain marvel to make it more believable but they just thrown that character too away...\\nAfter all how come captain marvel and thor are powerless characters and iron man / captain america powerful characters ?

Without that edge to him he is a scene chewing comic book *villain* in the worse way. I simply did not care about the plot because the villain is a snidely whiplash joke.

This would be better if the plotting wasn't redundant in the first place. Infinity War boiled down to 6 color coded chase scenes over MacGruffins. The same is true in Endgame but even more so. The plot device introduced to allow the team a fighting chance produces whole manners of plot contrivances, incoherence and murky what the heck is happening.

But what the writers did to the fans was really disrespectfull. They wrote off all the heroes whose contract is done with marvel in the most rediculous way possible. Oh make hulk all green , sacrifice black widow for no reason, make captain America old, uselessly old, and please don't get me started on the unnecessary killing of Iron man the God father of the what so called Marvel Cinematic universe. They wanted us to give up Our old heroes to make way for their new ones, but just because we are fan they can manipulate us the way they want, but just because we are fans this is the one thing we won't do. It's not easy for a fan to let go of his hero and move on. We deserve a better end than that, their heroes deserve a better end than that insult. For heaven sake even Loki deserve a better ending than that. As a fan I was ready to allow all the none sense the story had, but insult me and take away my favorite hero and I will eat you alive. I will allow the whole concept of time travel thing, but let's go through the logic they had to fix everything. They would go back in time and steal the stones from different timelines bring them to the future snap their fingers bring everyone back, okay after that it gets stupid they will return the stones back right when they took them, wait won't that be putting the stones for Thanos to take again in his own timeline to snap his fingers and repeat the loss AGAIN. Why wouldn't they just go to the past destroy one of the stones once and for all. That would have at least saved black widow. Why would iron man snap his fingers why didn't he use the power of the stones and kicked Thanos ass at least that would have given us the satisfaction of revenge. How did Thanos get all the pym particles to get almost all his planet on earth through time travel in quantum realm when the avengers themselves had only enough for ONE ROUND TRIP. Where did the Asgardians come from. Didn't Thanos destroy their whole ship in the start of infinity war. How did the valkirey get her white horse for heaven sake have some respect for our heads and what good did the flying horse do really Nothing. Why make Thor this miserable and useless, that's not fair to his fans at least, why give him 5 minutes chat with his mother when it does nothing to his morals or affect the story at all. Same for the starks father son meeting absolutely meaningless. Where was Thor and iron man when Thanos beat the hell out of captain America, sleeping ?!! The end fight scene was terrible in the least. Single fight no unity at all even though they were all there and what became of Thanos they did better fighting him when he had the stones now that he is without them he becomes invincible why?!! Just to kill away Iron man?!! And don't get me started on the boring out of context gay conversation captain America has with an unknown and why he gives his shield to falcon just because he is black, leaving Baky his almost brother behind. The girl power scene was crab and too imposed. Spider man comes back after 5 years to find his friends still at high school ?!!! You ruined it all Marvel ,you destroyed my 11 years of entertainment with a really horrible ending that just serves you and not the dedicated fans whom made this possible for you. That is a promise from me and I believe from many other fans WE WON'T BE SUCKED UP IN YOUR WORLD OR UNIVERSE OR WHATEVER AGAIN. THAT IS IT. FIND NEW FANS.\"},\n",

       "  'review_text': 'Today I saw \"Avengers: Endgame\", directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and many, many more. Oh man, what a cast! Just like \"Avengers: Infinity War\", I was blown away by this film. The Russo brothers have done it again! Great story, great acting, great special effects, great sets/locations, and great soundtrack. Every factor is top-notch in this movie! I am not going to spoil this movie. This is all I\\'m going to say about it. Is this the best superhero movie? No, there are some I personally like better. But, it\\'s in my top 10 for sure! Is it the new best Marvel movie? Well, it\\'ll probably find a spot in my top 5 on that list! Overall, the cast is extraordinary, and every character had their own shining moment. I was kind of skeptical about Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. Most of you know that I absolutely hate the Ant-Man comic book character. Nothing against Paul Rudd, but the movie version of Ant-Man is very obnoxious. I was worried he was going to ruin it with one-liners and jokes. But, to my surprise, he was not that bad. He played a critical factor in this movie, and his jokes were few and far between, and actually funny! The other characters are stellar as usual. Under the direction of the Russo Brothers, that\\'s not surprising! That\\'s all I\\'m going to say, I will not spoil the Endgame. You\\'ll have to go see the movie to find out how good it is for yourself! Believe me, you won\\'t be the same. If you think you know what this movie will be like from watching the trailers, you have no idea what you\\'re in for! Props to you, Anthony and Joe Russo. You guys did a Marvel-ous job again! I look forward to other future movies with your involvement, and I hope you continue to direct other superhero movies in the future! This movie is absolutely worth the money to see it in the theater and also to buy on DVD. Obviously, I give this film a full 5 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven\\'t seen \"Avengers: Endgame\" yet, what are you waiting for? Go check it out if you haven\\'t already! Remember, once you guys see it, DON\\'T SPOIL THE ENDGAME!'},\n",

That was pathetic and disrespectful to Infinity War, I felt personally offended by that story writing (or lack thereof). I get that Marvel movies are far from realistic, but generally, even with all the magical powers and very advanced technology, there is some sort of logical flow that these tend to follow (unlike Once Upon a Time hahaha) and most of the things that happen are explainable (ex. all the magic powers have some sort of understandable explanation/origin). That\\'s a bold statement by me, I know, but I stand by it. Anyways, all that logic was thrown out of the window with time travel. I read a comment that said, \"Time traveling is RARELY done right; when I see time traveling shenanigans that is clearly for plot convenience\". That basically expresses my feelings about time travel, especially in this movie. It is so far from reality that it\\'s almost comprehensible and thus it DOESN\\'T WORK! Yes, magical gauntlets and infinity stones are far from reality too, but those at least have some kind of constant consistency (well until this movie anyways --> Thanos destroys that which makes up and controls the universe without destroying the universe itself...that\\'s possible?). There is no consistency or logic to time travel. This is what I think of directors saying when I see them using time travel: \"The characters couldn\\'t beat the villain the first time around because they weren\\'t strong enough, so let\\'s just reverse everything and let them try again instead of thinking of a much more creative way of having them ultimately win.\" And COME ON, if they\\'re gonna use time travel, AT LEAST use the *Time Stone* instead of some alternate realm where you can apparently navigate both time and space (which Tony figured out in like 2 minutes and we never got a proper explanation on how he did it, because there is no feasible one) to when/wherever you want because your past is your future and your present is your past or whatever, and it is a different length of time than reality and what not. Also, when the Ancient One brought up different realities, I was pulling my hair...like really?'},\n",

       "  'review_text': '\\nThe movie itself was a huge collection of familiar faces and scenes, from all major events in MCU, lacking cohesive structure which distorted flow of the movie. The spectacle was too long and action sequences were unevenly spaced which created over too long moments that were more about homage to the last decade of superhero bonanza and tremendous logistic achievement. After all getting all of the cameo actors from the last movies and inserting them into this plot must have been very difficult. Did they suceed ? No, they did not. The effort was admirable and gave us some really touching moments but resulted in unnecessary extending already too long movie. This was confusing the main story plot too much. There were just too much of it. Movie did not offer viewer any spectacular skirmishes in a first two hours. Thats what made IW so special. Endgage was lacking these impactful moments. It is clear that the best was saved for last but this only validates that movie did not have to be so long. If a movie would be filled with IW level of awesome than yeah, bring it on but the problem is that it was stretched too thin and these moments are just not there, not in the beginning anyway.'},\n",

Younger audience and older audience looked bored in the cinema though. The balance was not achieved here.\"},\n",

       "  'review_text': 'Personally I found it mediocre at best. Too many contradictions to count. So thors hammer DOES grant him the power of lightning? I know Odin tells thor that it doesn\\'t give him those powers but only helps him channel them, so what, cap has had that ability the whole time but saved it or never knew till now? And what\\'s with the whole changing the past doesnt change the future? How does anything they do then accomplish anything. And why does nebulas eye thing just conveniently decide to play the most incriminating thing possible, when it could play anything in reality. I\\'m glad at least that the 1 dimensional captain marvel was not present most of the film, that at least was a plus. And further more, why was tony seemingly un injured from the stones, yet died? Is he a god and we never knew? Half god quil was nearly turned to ash from just one in seconds, tony used them all. I just dont how they ended up deciding to go down some of these paths. It\\'s like they never saw any of the past movies. And hulk?bruce? Beta Hulk? What ever he is, he managed to find a way to be more useless than in the last film. Seriously what did he even do other than the first fix snap? Why not let thor do it, I think he could take the power of it if he can handle the full force of a stars radiation in the vaccum of space. And then cap just stays in the past like an a hole and watched all this horrible stuff unfold? How did any of the events that led up to it happen then with out him? They never needed him at all? And if you cant change the past, then how does he stay and literally change the past by being in it? Too many self creating paradoxes that they basically tell you to screw yourself if you start asking \"wait but why....?\" All in all, I think what we experienced here is they peaked with infinity war, and cant make something as good. I mean cmon, thanos had the personality of a lobster in this film. It felt like we were dealing with an unknown enemy, yet we do know him.... and Gamora died in infinity war yet never comes back? Why? Because it was the soul stone thst she died for? Then arent you changing the past by removing that Gamora from the time line? And why is Thor like a broken sexual assault victim, hes the GOD of thunder for crying out loud. and why does Thanos\\' most impractical weapon ever, his double sided sword thing, just absolutely demolish cap\\'s shield? Did Tony give him a fake lol? And we get to see Loki grab the tesseract and vanish, and we never see the follow up to that? What a loss of a good plot line, follow lokito find it and enlist his help against thanos. HOW DOESNT IT CHANGE ANYTHING?!?!?! Seriously it just seems like lazy writing on their end more than anything else. Like someone got half this plot and someone pointed out, hey changing the past changes the future you know, so they were like ahh crap that\\'s right, well, just have beta hulk give some science nonsense spiel about it and that should clear things up. And if taking past gemora to the future to replace the one they lost works fine..... why doesnt anyone go grab the Tony from before he left to get the stones? If changing the past doesnt change the future, how does it stop him from sacrificing himself? Same goes for black widow. The final battle seen wasnt that great either, I like my fair share of female super heroes but just the whole girl squad assemble thing was a little too much, like they all conveniently ended up in the same place at the same time, cmon we all know you just wanted you PC plug, you guys are more creative than that, that was just desperate and laughable. I\\'m a big fan of marvel movies, and to be fair this one had the most to live up to, but I still feel like they didnt do it justice. Perhaps they shouldve taken more time between films. Oh well. If the spider man movie is no good as well, I think I\\'ll be parting ways with marvel films.'},\n",

I loved Infinity war, so I was really looking forward to this. Half hour in I got that sinking feeling, I tried to shake it and stay positive but to no avail. I got to the point where it was so painful I made a conscious decision to rather have a sleep that to endure the dreadful plot and weak representation of our much loved hero's. We were lied to at the end of Infinity War. When Fury drops his pager and calls for Captain Marvel, we did not know she was would be accompanied by Major Disappointment. Her character was pitched to save the day but she was incapable of doing that - half the movie we did not even know where she was.

Have you worked so long on all these films that you got burnt out? Do you hate the Hulk and Thor characters so much that you would do what you did to them?\\nTime travel to fix things is just lazy writing. Plain and simple. Lazy, unimaginative, boring, and it will always fail to make sense.\\nLet's just start at the beginning of the film. It's the best part other than how did Captain Marvel finds Tony but we can let that slide. It really does not matter.\\nFive years later was your first mistake. By doing this you have shown the world is in collapse. People can not move on. Garbage everywhere, everything is in decay. Only Tony Stark has seen to be able to move on and have a child and be happy. Great. This is where it gets bad.\\nYou have made Tony Stark completely selfish again. Just like his first film. He never wants to sacrifice anything of his own to make things right. You gave him a daughter and the second you did that, the second you did that, you had to take her away. You had no choice if you wanted to make it a good movie. That is what he was going to have to lose to fix what had been done by Thanos. But you do not even make it an option.\\nHe stipulates that they can all go back in time as long as they don't change the last five years! Why?! The whole world is in mourning. The world sucks. How many people killed themselves after the snap? How many people lost everything they own after the snap? How many children lost their parents? How many parents lost their children? But Tony is happy, so, that's all that matters. Horrible. You made me hate Tony Stark.\\nNext point. Why do they need a spaceship to go to Thanos? Thor has Stormbreaker. Stormbreaker can make a bifrost bridge to anywhere! Thor can go anywhere he wants now. Anywhere! No spaceship needed.\\nThanos? What did you do to the villain you made so great in the previous film. He has five years in retirement and he's ready to die? Let me explain something to you guys. People do not spend their entire lives to achieve something only to want to die five minutes after they achieve it.\\nThanos. Poor Thanos. What you did. Thanos would never, ever just sat there and let himself be killed. He knew when he did the snap that people would come after him. He would have been ready. He would have never of destroyed the stones. They would be his greatest protection.\\nNow that you killed Thanos and you destroyed the stones, you put yourselves in a box. How can we fix this? I know, time travel. Quantum Realm time travel. Side note, Janet Van Dyne (Mrs Pym) was in the Quantum Realm for 30 years and she aged 30 years. We'll forget about that movie though.\\nThen you guys think we'll go back and get all the stones from earlier movies. Wrong! You don't have to. All you needed to do was go back and get the Tesseract and the time stone. The Tesseract to travel the galaxy. (Which you really don't need because of Stormbreaker but never mind that) and the time stone to fix the time line. The infinity stones are much more powerful than you guys think or realize. Watch the first Guardians of the Galaxy film if you do not know what I mean.\\nYou guys made the script so much harder on yourselves than you had to be. Maybe this is what happens when people spend too much time on one type of characters.\\nDid you guys forget who the characters are? Captain America does not look at his own ass and make a comment. He does not care. It is not in his personality at all in any other film. He does not have any vanity. It is one of the reasons that Peggy Carter likes him.\\nThor. Poor, poor, Thor. Your lazy writing here is unforgivable. The fat Thor was funny for 15 seconds and then it was irritating for the rest of the film. You should have never of done it. Thor should have been traveling the nine realms with stormbreaker, trying to help those realms recover from the snap. That's what Thor would have been doing. Thor would have tried to do something productive. All of Thor's previous movies meant nothing to you. The character meant nothing to you. How Chris Hemsworth played that part without crying in every scene is beyond me. I hope he was devastated to what you did to his character.\\nThe Hulk? Do you guys even know who he is? You hid him in the infinity wars, it was okay. I got it. It made it different, but not to bring him back or to bring him in the way you did here, is beyond belief. We needed to see that transformation. We needed to see how Banner and the Hulk became one. Okay, forget that, you did let us see Banner in the Hulk form but we never got to see a smart Hulk get revenge on Thanos. A smart Hulk who knows how to fight because he is now smart because you wrote him that he is now smart. Wasted opportunity.\\nVision by the way. No resurrection? No mention at all. Really?\\nHawkeye? There's a guy that enjoyed the last five years. Maybe Tony would like to lose his family and not to want to change the last five years.\\nAnother problem. After the new snap, when you brought everyone back. Hawkeye's wife came back with her cell phone? He has her cell phone charged and on the kitchen counter waiting for her to come back? Did the cell phone company's service survive the snap? Are you telling me that Clint kept the same cell phone plan for five years? Think about that for a second. And this not something I realized after the film. I realized it as it a occurred, sitting in my seat in the theater. Bad writing.\\nRomanoff. She never needed to die because you never needed the Soul stone and two things on that: When Captain America returns the the Soul stone, did he see the Red Skull? That would have been interesting. And second when he returns the Soul Stone, Romanoff comes back too! Another thing you guys did not think that through though.\\nAnt-man? I love Paul Rudd, but Ant man was useless. His daughter does not miss her Mom though? I guess she is like Tony and does not want to undo the last five years.\\nNo Fury and Captain Marvel reunion scene? Why not? Don't really care that it was not there, but hey I should at least mention it.\\nBack to Captain America. He would never had stayed in the past and married Peggy. He would not have taken her away from the man she winds up marrying and having kids with. He would never had done that in a million years. He would not have abandoned Bucky. Bucky has no family or friends. None. Steve would not have left hm. Steve would not have left all the people that he had met after the snap. Those people still need help.\\nLet me explain your own script to you. When they reverse the snap and everybody reappears after a five year gap. When Peter Parker goes back to school, half his class is gone. They have all aged and graduated. Make sure you have that in the next Spiderman movie. Plus, the people that came back, did they go back to work? The jobs were still there? How about all the houses that have begun to rot? Who repaired them all? What about people who moved and got remarried? Yeah, let's not remove the last five years. Lets just leave it all intact.\\nWhat should have happened is what happens in Marvel movies. It should have been fun. It should have made sense. Captain Marvel, who is really the only one able to hold any infinity stones,should of, with the help of all the other characters, gone back in time. With the use of the time stone and the tesseract. She shows up when Thor hits Thanos with Stormbreaker at the end of Infinity Wars and she cuts off Thanos's arm before he does the snap or takes the glove from him. Then Thor kills Thanos or lets him live for another day and Captain Marvel uses the Tesseract to open a portal and disappear before anyone even gets to ask her a question. Timeline in tack. Captain Marvel returns the Soul stone to a very unhappy Red Skull who is now trapped on Vormir again and Gamora returns from the Soul stone.\\nThanos could have been alive and chasing all the other characters. Trying to stop them from undoing everything he had done. Better yet, he should have had an arc and realized that what he had done did not go as planned and in the end he lets them win.\\nEither way the movie should have ended with Tony giving up his daughter, sacrificing his new family to give everyone else their families back.\\nAfter all is done. Captain America could have just retired and passed the mattel along. Tony would have retired too after seeing how great life is with Pepper and then tried to make his daughter again.\\nAll of these endings are better than what you did but they are also not perfect. I just don't have all the time in the world to think up better ways to make other peoples films.\\nWhat I do have time though, is to go to movies and enjoy them from time to time and for the last 11 years I have enjoyed most Marvel films. Sadly to say but I think I am done with Marvel. I feel as if you guys, the Russo Brothers have killed it all. All the build up, all the time spending with these characters just so you could change them and ruin them the way you did. I feel as if they have died.\\nI know my opinion is just that, my opinion. I feel that this movie is this generations Return of the Jedi. I loved Jedi when it came out. 5 years later, I hated it. End Game will be that movie for these young people. They love it now, but give it a few years and we will see.\\nThis I guess is my obituary for the mcu. I felt so empty after seeing this movie. I felt like it was all a waste. I felt like my friends had died or left me and were not coming back. I needed to get this all out of my system and just say good-bye.\\nI apologize for my poor grammar. If I could get the Time Stone, I would use it to go back to school and actually listen to my English teacher.\\nThis is all a very sad ending to what could have been a great era of movies.\"},\n",

I saw it in Imax 3d and i feared i will not enjoy it , because action movies with fast scenes dont feel so good in 3d, but because of its slower pace, one could really enjoy the scenery, especially the space scenes. I generally liked the plot(going back in time etc), although there are serious holes in the plot but whatever, its a comic book fantasy movie so anything goes, right. Going back and revisiting crucial moments was also done very well,funny and reminding of all the other great MCU movies, it really tied up everything well. There was not so many obvious jokes, but still few good funny moments.\\nThe downside for me is how I never can understand how this superheros match their powers - like in the beginning, Captain Marvel grabs Thanos, Thor slices him up like a chunk of butter,. but on the end fight, she cannot get to him, and Thor fights him both with his axe and hammer, plus Captain America and Iron-man and they cannot do anything to him. Thanos has some strange looking blade which is obviously much stronger than all their weapons , and Captain Marvel. So this really bothers me even in the previous movies, is like the script writers can write whatever they want and anything goes, right. Again you can see, I can tolerate so much BS until i start to get bored and feel like i dont have an IQ less then 80 or im 12 years old.\\nI dont see why it had to be 3 hour long, they could easily cut down the drama BS and make it 2.5h. Also, I am really really sad that Black Widow is gone - she was the best for me, a true hero without any gadgets, super powers or powerful weapons. And finally, its sad that all american series and movies put a lot of point on the characters making a drama , fuss and blaming each other - adults and especially super heroes should be more balanced - and that was Natasha's part in the MCU, she was always so rational and calm .\\nI will watch this once more it comes out on Bluray but i dont i will be coming back more then that.

Thanos has zero stones, and the Avengers (with the addition to Captain Marvel !!!) have less success against him. Would love an explanation behind this logic.\\n4. I personally thought Captain America quitting aka retiring was extremely dumb. The guy who never gives up on his optimism and moving forward just throws all of that aside.\\n5. The Soul Stone scene was far too played out. It was embarrassingly long. Overdid the \"who will end up dying\" even though it\\'s 100% obvious! I mean, why would the movie open on Clint and his family for nothing? Wouldn\\'t be surprised if this scene caused people to walk out of the theater.\\n6. I would have loved to see Captain Marvel have a significant role in this movie. Instead we got more Tilda Swindon screen time than Captain Marvel. Unforgivable.'},\n",

And some how captain America gains the ability to shoot lightning? For this reason Thor (arguably the strongest avenger ever in the comics and also portrayed that way in the previous film Infinity War ) could have been completely removed from the end game because he is made out to be helpless and his abilities (which used to be those of a god) can now be possessed by humans. While all other marvel films remain true to the characters and there unrelenting will to save the universe, this film seems to take some of the strongest hero\\'s in the MCU and reduce them to zeros.

I have seen every marvel movie that has been release and watched and liked Infinity war though I thought it dragged on. No super hero movie should ever go for more than 2 hours...EVER. Now it has dawned on me that disney and the writers of this flick had nothing but cash in mind when planning these. The first Avengers was amazing, i believed that age of ultron was the forerunner for something epic with Thanos then these 2 movies were just a massive let down but it's all about cash and I took the bait. Hook, line and sinker. A final movie is supposed to give all the answers but this just gave me so many questions and left me confused and wondering whether I loved or hated it. Now it has sunk in and I gave it thoght i just hate it. Too many contradictions. Don't get me wrong. The action is good in this movie and there are parts I loved about it but the parts i hate out weighed them. Damn you Disney!!!!\"},\n",

I've watched this movie 3 times to make sure my feelings were true and they are this movie made me upset and disappointed. I hated what they did to Thor, yes i understand he was depressed and all but they really did him dirty and it wasn't funny or appreciated. They nerfed Hulk, and he got no rematch with Thanos he didn't even do anything Hulky. The plot was too stupid and confusing. What happened with Cap? How is he an old man now that popped up out of nowhere in the end? How did Thanos and his whole entire army get to the future? Did Dr. Strange know that a rat would ultimately save mankind? How waa strombreaker not able to do anything against Thanos? Why is Thanos stronger WITHOUT the gauntlet?\\nAlso Captain Marvel was pretty useless in this movie with that nauseating haircut.\\nMy beloved Black Widow is dead and didn't get a funeral or anything! Why didn't they bring her back from a different time lime or whatever like they did Gamora?\\nAnd Bucky got robbed too! He should have picked up the shield not Falcon.\\nI could go on and on for days. I think everyone is so caught up in the hype they didn't actually give any thought to what they were watching.

A woman whose past was never taken serious, her narrative taken away from her by the egocentric male heroes who treated her like their secretary rather than a teammate. Romanov did NOT deserve such a crude and dismissive ending. I will say the same thing for the rest of the female characters that were alive and could\\'ve gotten more spotlight than the \"boys\" fighting about their little toys and reminiscing about past times. I saw no true Avengers in Endgame; it was dull, slow, and it felt like a movie re-run of past events. Hulk was irrelevant, no rage, no epic fight against Thanos; Thor was more of a broken human than a superior alien who possessed far more experience in battle, far more powerful, yet he was just a lamentable junkie missing his mommy; that\\'s not how a king rules. \"Sore-Eye\" was such a butt-hole to look at, a criminal by choice; murdering people that had nothing to do with his family\\'s demise, but the Russo\\'s felt like he deserved the redemption just to keep the plot going, frankly, this character was quite insufferable and useless, and in my opinion: he should\\'ve had die instead of Natasha. Captain Marvel\\'s introduction was hostile and dense; the woman looked like she had no idea what was going on and not appropriately welcomed by her new teammates, so it felt like a high school newbie who just entered the classroom being introduced to bullies, and I think this character could\\'ve worked better being introduced after Endgame.

No, not not even close. This movie has some of the worst pacing in this entire franchise, some of the most contrived writing, and some of the biggest plot holes the franchise has ever created. And none of that was something that was made by accident. All of that was achieved solely because the writers/directors wanted to have something in the movie so badly, they ignored their own continuity. They shoved moments and gags that would be sort-of funny or sort-of interesting as standalone moments, but would fall apart when compared to the rest of the continuity. This movie is trying to be like Back to the Future, Lord of the Rings, Inception, and Interstellar at the same time, but manages to not even be half as good as either of them. The only real saving grace in this movie is that there is finally some finality to some of the characters, which was something the MCU always avoided doing because they always used the characters by thinking what will put more money in their valets, not what will have more heart. Oh, and you might be wondering why I don't mention Thanos? Well, no spoilers, but if you expect to be as impressed by him as you were in the previous movie, you're in for disappointment. Overall, this movie was not worth the wait, and this movie will not age well after you'll re-watch it multiple times and see why it's so fundamentally broken.\"},\n",

Disappointing.\\nIf you've seen all the other MCU movies you might get a kick out of all the references and jokes based on those, that's the stuff I greatly enjoyed. Endgame didn't take itself and it's characters too seriously and at times this worked out really well. But regretfully, there are others parts where this change of plans destroyed the movie for me.\\nI don't know, turning Thor into an alcoholic, lazy dude who does nothing besides playing Fortnite (yes, Fortnite is in this movie) all day just isn't funny at all and ruins the hard work Taika Waititi has put into him. I also hate what they did to Hulk/Banner, I always thought Banner was an extremly likeable and interesting character, but in this movie I couldn't stand him.\\nMost of the other characters are just _fine_, Tony and Steve being the only ones who really stand out. Endgame gives either of those characters important decisions to make and their dynamic is absolutely entertaining.\\nSteve's ending though was just awful. Not only was it predictable ever since we knew time travel would be part of the plot, it wasn't satisfying at all. Steve leaving his two best friends behind, who he hadn't seen in f i v e years, just to hang with the girl he met for a few weeks eighty years ago AFTER he already made out with her niece is just unbearable.

His relationship with his family along with the amazing performance by Robert Downey Jr. made his ending all the more heartbreaking. Steve Rogers strapping on his broken shield and standing up to Thanos in his 'I can do this all day' manner was a reminder of why we love him. But his ending was forced and completely betrayed his character. Even Chris Evans' performance (honestly I can't even imagine anyone else playing Captain America) cannot save Steve Rogers from bad writing. We have seen him say goodbye to Peggy In Winter Soldier. And after five or so movies of not even mentioning her, Peggy is his only way for a happy ending? This is a complete disservice to Peggy's character which was developed in Agent Carter after Steve crashed the plane into the arctic. We see Steve pining after his long lost love rather than mourning his friends whom he lost in the snap. This completely discredits the relationships he formed in the 21st century and his relationship with Bucky. Thor was shown to be completely depressed and lonely. After what he has been through, this is completely justified. But he contributes nothing to the team despite being one of the original six Avengers and the fat jokes started becoming distasteful after a while. He was a well loved character among the fans and the writers didn't even give him a proper conclusion. Natasha's character was treated very badly. Hell, she didn't even get a proper funeral. Hawkeye having a family helps us connect more with his character. But that's all his character has going for him. Professor Hulk felt kind of bland. I missed his trademark anger which was portrayed so well in the previous movies. Nebula, Rocket, Scott Lang and Rhodey had pretty good characters despite not having much of an arc. The female characters (besides Natasha) didn't have much importance to the story and I felt that the final showdown with all the female characters was put there as part of a political agenda more than anything else. Don't get me wrong, I love strong female characters. But spending a whole movie without even mentioning them and then showing a badass 2 minute sequence with all of them is not female representation. Even Captain Marvel had very less screen time. And finally coming to Thanos. Thanos was a nuanced, relatable and, at some points, reasonable villain in Infinity War. But all that character development regresses in Endgame. In Endgame he is presented as a generic villain who is evil just for the sake of being evil.\"},\n",

I wish could have experienced in on IMAX because the movie has been shot entirely with IMAX cameras. Endgame's plot doesn't work for me all the time travel thing was messy. It can be suitable for comics but cinematic universe should has been different. First hour of the movie was slow, it could be shortened but I like first hour because it showed us heroes struggles and their human side for example, Cap was in a therapy group and iron man's relationship with his daughter. when the movie approaches the end it dragges you so 3 hours long doesn't bother you. on the other hand, I can't say that Endgame is better than Infinity war or vice versa. Both movies have their own moments I think Endgame's emotional tone was better but Infinity war's humor and battle scenes were better. I feel disappointed final battle of Endgame it was concluded too quickly Russo brothers' battle scenes in Civil war and Infinity war were better than Endgame. I was very angry with absence of Hulk Infinity war but I liked him in in this movie and I also liked Thor and Rocket too. Lastly, I am pleased Iron man and Cap's endings and also widow's their fates in the movie was very emotional. Although, its ridiculous time-travel plot it has its own moments completes 22 films's integrated saga. I give 7 point out of 10.\"},\n",

It\\'s a bold decision that ensures the MCU remains scarred by Thanos\\' infamous snap.\\nBut the five-year gap leads to a lot of questions. What about the people who died in those five years? And as CNET editor Mike Sorrentino pointed out, what if someone moved on in life and remarried in that period? That would make for an awkward reunion.'},\n",

As she said in Avengers, \"I\\'ve got red in my ledger, I\\'d like to wipe it out.\" Consider it wiped.\\nBut there\\'s the persistent buzz that Black Widow will star in her own film. Sure, it could be a prequel, but this is a comic book universe, and deaths are all too easily reversed. In fact, of all the people left supposedly dead at the end of Endgame, three -- Black Widow, Loki and the Vision -- are all headlining future MCU movies and TV shows.\\nWhere\\'s Vision?\\nWith WandaVision coming to the Disney Plus streaming service, there was a chance that Vision would return. But aside from a passing reference at the end by Wanda, Vision was nowhere to be found. The show could be a prequel to Infinity War, but in that movie Shuri was working on separating Vision from his Infinity Stone -- could he be resurrected without it?\\nIs Hulk\\'s consciousness gone?\\nBruce Banner and the Hulk have merged into \"Professor Hulk.\" It seems Bruce is more in control, presumably submerging the Hulk personality we last saw in Thor: Ragnarok.
